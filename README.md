# ICL

Project by: Ana Grilo(49930) and Joana Cardoso(47338)

Running the project: To run the project as an interpreter simply run as a normal project. The result of the input expression will be printed out in the console. To run the project as a compiler go to run applications and run it with a -c as argument. The results will be printed out in the file file.j.

If you want to test a def function note that after each end you write you will need to add a ;.
Example:
def x=2 in def y=3 in def k=7 in x+y+k end; end; end;
